Blinks LEDs Clock-wise (CW)

Problems: 
1. Make sure to use the same compiler for each program. I used mac's eclipse AND raspberry pi's default python compiler and received runtime errors.
2. For buttons use if/elif because there are more than two states
3. Connect positive resistors to buttons because positive = false and negative = true
